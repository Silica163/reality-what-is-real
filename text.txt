room0:
This is a first of sixteen room in this game.
You can walk with WASD, JIKL, or arrow keys. And look around using mouse.
The gole of this game is to get out of this 16 room, find something REAL, discover some ILLUSION, and find the REAL you.
Look at four cubes on the floor, it can tell the which room you are.
<delay>
Don't trust the wall.

room1:
Look like you pass the first room, there are 15 room left to go. goodluck.
<delay>
You can go back to the first room by following the black arrow.

room8:
It's boring to walk through wall right?
Did you know you can switch to third person point of view with V if you want.
<after switch>
Look around.
Did you see, this room is just a cube.

room15:
Every room has two way to enter, one is the black arrow, another is one of three remaining wall.
I mean EVERY room including this room and the first one.

room16:
Finally, you find the exit.
I recommended you to explore this area outside the room behind you.
Here, you can fly, walk and move anyway you want.
But remember, EVERY room have 2 way to enter.
<long delay>
Did you look at the floor?
If you didn't, may be look at the floor please.
<delay>
See the shadow? It's a cube's shadow right?
But when you use the third person POV you see a sphere, why?

after enter room 15 from room 16(-1):
Do you remember this room?
Y: Yes
N: you don't?
It's room 15, all 16 room just another illusion.
It's just a cube you saw before you enter this room.
<delay>
Do you want to explore this game more?
Y: Ok. You can exit this game with ESC
N: <QUIT, CREDIT MENU>
